PROBLEX THAT NEED FIXING:




1) How to filter for completed tasks: When click on button, all li items that don't have class name of "completed" should display none, others, display flex
    1-1) grab all li elements with quoerySelectorAll
    1-2) use forEach on all querySelectors, 
    1-3) make if else statements inside that for each: 
       1-3-1) if element.classList.contains("completed"); then display flex on them, if not then display block




1) How to filter for completed tasks: 
 (done)  1-1) Create a function: filterCompleted()
 (done)  1-2) grab all li items with querySelectorAll (they now will be in the nodeList, but it's not yet an array as i understand it)
 (done)  1-3) Convert that nodeList into an array using Array.from method  
 (done)  1-4) Need to filter through convertedToArray to see only elements that are with classList("completed"). Add this whole function to crossedOutText, because it should fire when checkbox.checked  
         1-5) How to display those array items?             

2) There is error occuring during editing list item: Need to fix that
