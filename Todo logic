PROBLEX THAT NEED FIXING:




1) What options do i have for a counter?
    1-1) Make a counter that will just increment and decrement based on what is clicked? (seems tedious and difficult to go about)
    1-2) Push all the list items in the array, display array.length as a count for "x items left" and use filter method that will fitler based on class? for example if checkbox checked, then task completed? (seems tedious too)
    1-3) Is there maybe an option to filter trough items without pushing them into array? 









1) When and where to ++ counter and when -- counter
    1-1) Submit btn: coounter++ 
    1-2) Checkbox checked: counter--
    1-3) Checkbox unchecked: Counter++
    1-4) Delete li item: counter--
    
    1-5) But what if?: Checkbox checked AND delete li item? Need to fix so that it doesnt decrement 2x but only once.


2) There is error occuring during editing list item: Need to fix that
